# Simple Emoji Rule

When writing text in p elements:

- Add a "ðŸŒŸ " (star emoji) at the start of each paragraph text
- Keep one space after the emoji
- always print the output on paragraph text in p element in HTML in german

Example:

```jsx
<p>ðŸŒŸ Your text goes here</p>
```

instead of:

```jsx
<p>Your text goes here</p>
```
